IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition &amp; Performance

This dataset is use to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and it is use to explore important questions.

Insights I found:
When looking at the employee sales only 20% left the organization and 80% did not.

We also looked at how the monthly average income of those with attrition and non attrition from the employees sales compared. The average monthly income from the employee sales is 6,959.64$. For those who left the organization that average was 5,913.04$ and for those who stayed it was 7,231.64$. From these number you can see that those who left were underperforming from the rest of the organization.
